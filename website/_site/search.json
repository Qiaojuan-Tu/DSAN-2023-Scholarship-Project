    "text": "- A Closer Look at Data Job Postings in April 2023\nlink\nThe job market for data-related positions has seen a steady growth in recent years, fueled by the explosion of big data and artificial intelligence. However, for new graduates who are aspiring to enter this field, the prospect of securing a job can be daunting, especially during a time when many tech companies are laying off employees. This raises questions about the current state of the data job market and the challenges that new graduates may face in finding employment. In this project, we will explore the difficulties of finding data-related jobs in the current job market and examine where recent graduates stand in the face of competition and limited opportunities."
